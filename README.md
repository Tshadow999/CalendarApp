# CalendarApp

An all purpose calendar application. Which, when finished, will bring me and you joy.

## Functionalities (When finished)

-[x] Month and week views of all dates;
-[] Read and display ICS files in the calendar view;
-[] Add/Edit events;
-[] Reminders / notifications of events;
-[] Customization of the application;
 
## Made with Godot 4.2 
Made the switch from Unity to Godot and I am loving this engine.

## Why not use an existing?

Because I dislike all calendar apps I have tried so far.
