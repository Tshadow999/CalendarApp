# CalendarApp

An all purpose calendar application, with loads of customization.

## Functionalities (When finished)

- Month views of all dates; [DONE]
- Read and display ICS files in the calendar view;
- Add/Edit events;
- Reminders / notifications of events;
- Customization of the application;
 
## Made with Godot 4.2 
Made the switch from Unity to Godot and I am loving this engine.

## Why not use an existing?

Because I dislike all calendar apps I have tried so far.
